## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flex box fluently, as well as using clamp() to adjust responsive easier.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 3em;

  font-size: clamp(3em, 1.5vw, 5em);
}
```

### Continued development

I will create multiple cards like this and display in a grid in future.
